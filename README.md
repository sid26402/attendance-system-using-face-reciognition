# attendance-system-using-face-reciognition

hey there readers!!!
this is a face recognition base Attendance System which uses webcam to recognitize the faces and matches it with the added database pictures and marks the attendance .

firstly new need to create a file as mention in code  as path ='ImageAttendance'
then we need to add the photos in that file as jpeg for example "name.jpeg" to make a database for program.
then we need to make sure the images you saved in file "ImageAttendance " should be like name.jpeg to let program split and mark the attendance accordingly 
all the other things remain same 
thanks!!!!
